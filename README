Trac Advanced Search Plugin
README


Still under development.




__ Requirements __

easy_install httplib2
easy_install pysolr
easy_install simplejson (for python < 2.6)



__ Configuration __

In trac.ini you'll need to configure whichever search backend you're using.  If
you're using the default pysolr backend, add something like this:

[pysolr_search_backend]
solr_url = http://localhost:8983/solr/
timeout = 30 


__ Remove Search button __

To disable the old search add the following to <project_env>/conf/trac.ini.
Your trac.ini may already have a components section.

[components]                                                                                                                   
trac.search.web_ui.SearchModule = disabled

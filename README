Trac Advanced Search Plugin
---------------------------
README

This Trac plugin allows you to use a full-text search engine (such as solr) as
the search backend for performing search in Trac.  This plugin also includes a
backend for solr, but other plugins can use the extension point provided to
use a different backend.

See the interface in plugin-src/advsearch/interface.py for details about which
methods to implement.

See http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDev for more information about developing
a Trac plugin.



__ Project Status __
Still under development.



__ Requirements __

The following python packages are required for the solr backend.

easy_install httplib2
easy_install pysolr
easy_install simplejson (for python < 2.6)



__ Installation __

This assumes you already have a Trac environment setup.

1. Build and install the plugin
cd plugin-src 
python setup.py bdist_egg
cp ./dist/TracAdvancedSearch-0.2-py2.5.egg <trac_environment_home>/plugins

2. Setup the search backend.  If you're using solr, copy and modify the 
configuration files provided.
cp ./solr/conf/* <solr_home>/conf

3. Index your current tickets and wiki pages in the search backend.  If you're
using solr, see ./solr/conf/data-config.xml

4. Configure your trac.ini (see the Configuration section below).

5. Restart the trac server. This will differ based on how you are running trac (apache, tracd, etc).

That's it. You should see an Advanced Search button in the main navbar.



__ Configuration __

In trac.ini you'll need to configure whichever search backend you're using.  If
you're using the default pysolr backend, add something like this:

[pysolr_search_backend]
solr_url = http://localhost:8983/solr/
timeout = 30 



__ Remove Search button __

To disable the old search add the following to <project_env>/conf/trac.ini.
Your trac.ini may already have a components section.

[components]                                                                                                                   
trac.search.web_ui.SearchModule = disabled  



__ TODO __

- Filters for ticket only properties
- improved summary

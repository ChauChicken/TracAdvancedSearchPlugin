Trac Advanced Search Plugin
---------------------------
README

This Trac plugin allows you to use a full-text search engine (such as solr) as
the search backend for performing search in Trac.  This plugin also includes a
backend for solr, but other plugins can use the extension point provided to
use a different backend.

See the interface in plugin-src/advsearch/interface.py for details about which
methods to implement.

See http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDev for more information about developing
a Trac plugin.



__ Project Status __
Still under development.



__ Requirements __

The following python packages are required for the solr backend.

easy_install httplib2
easy_install pysolr
easy_install simplejson (for python < 2.6)



__ Configuration __

In trac.ini you'll need to configure whichever search backend you're using.  If
you're using the default pysolr backend, add something like this:

[pysolr_search_backend]
solr_url = http://localhost:8983/solr/
timeout = 30 



__ Remove Search button __

To disable the old search add the following to <project_env>/conf/trac.ini.
Your trac.ini may already have a components section.

trac.search.web_ui.SearchModule = disabled
